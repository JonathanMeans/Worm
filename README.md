This is a simple Worm game. The Worm is controlled by the arrow keys.
Press any key from the title screen or the game over screen to play.
If you click instead, the worm will play itself
(Actually, I might still need to add that...)
(Anyway, I'm tired of this project, and tired of Python, so it
probably won't be fixed).

title.py contains the main loop.
worm_obj.py contains all of the objects.
worm_fun.py contains some useful functions.
